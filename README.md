DCM Player is a music player webapp that we provide to play music lyrics stored online.

With this application, we hope to be able to help musicians everywhere. Because this is the place to share your musical experiences.


>Regarding the copyright of the songs uploaded here, we are only a party that provides upload services and lyric music players, in other words, the music uploaded by users does not mean that the song belongs to the user! and if the user claims verbally in the input column that he is the owner of the song when in fact he is not, then we will take firm action by deleting the song and blocking the user. The information we record about the user will be submitted to the original song owner. Read more [Privacy Policy](https://darkcluemusic.github.io/privacy-policy/).
